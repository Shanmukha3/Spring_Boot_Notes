default port of consul: 8500



1. monolithic application:
	1. Drawbacks:
		1. difficult to scale
		2. difficult to maintain
		3. difficult to handle the load
2. Micro services:
	1. it is a architectural style of developing the application.
	2. every entity will have separate database and separate tables


steps to convert monolithic to Microservices:
1. split the db to individual schema
2. key value pair in the consul to register/discover the MS is configured in YAML format for each MS.
3. keep common lines of all the db in config/application: 
	username, password
4. individual are kept inside config/____MS/data
	schema URL
5. YAML - yet another markup language
6. two types of YAML:
	1. Bootstrap.yml  - read during bootstrap phase
	2. application.yml - read during application execution
	3. 1st Bootstap will read then application
	4. if both yml files have same data then properties in bootstrap will be overridden by properties in application



Circuit Breaker:
1. it will break/ wait for some time and will come to normal state like phone password entering
	ex: 	3 times password entering
		60 sec
		2 times password entering
		160 sec
