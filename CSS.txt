ol>li*2>li> enter
Alt + shift + downarrow - to get same thing in above one
ctrl + D  - to select all such words
style applied for parent class will also applied for child class also but not for all childs, it is with only immediate childs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. CSS is a decelerative language which means we don't bother about what happen on backend just we will use for application.
2. properties:
	1. color  		: diff colors
	2. text-align		: left, right, center, justify
	3. text-decoration	: none, underline, overline, line-through, blink
	4. font-size		: px or em value
	5. font-style		: normal, Italic, oblique, initial, inherit
	6. background-color	: give color, transparent
	7. border		: 5px solid red
	8. border-radius	: 5px
	9. overflow		: scroll, hidden, auto, visible
	10. display		: none, block, inline-block
	11. opacity		: number(means 0.5)
	12. background-image	: url()
	13. text-transform	: uppercase, lowercase

3. CSS selectors: Selector is a pattern that can select multiple HTML elements using the HTML element attributes like class, id, etc...
	1. Tag_Name{property: value}Â 
	2. types of selectors:
		1. Universal selector - *
		2. id   - #
		3. class - .
		4. type - directly use the attribute.
		5. attribute selector: 
			1. p[id] - select all p with any id
			2. [attribute=keyword]-
				1. p[id="pId"] - select all p with same id
				2. [attribute *= keyword]  : select which is having keyword any where in that attribute.
				3. [attribute^=keyword]  : select which is having keyword at beginning.
				4. [attribute$=keyword]  : select which is having keyword at end of value.
				attribute can be anything like id, href,name etc.
				[ name^= "happy"] {/*Styling properties*/} selects <div name="happyFace">Hello World</div>
	3. Combinators: he selectors formed by combining multiple selectors and establishing a relationship between the selectors.
		1. Selector1 (>, +, ~, (space)) Selector2
		2. The different types of combinators are:
			1. Descendant Combinator  :
				1.Selector1 Selector2{}
				2. #firstDiv .p1{}
			2. Child Combinator
				1. Selector1 > Selector2 {}
				2. ol>li{} - just child of ol ki
			3. Adjacent Sibling Combinator
				1. Selector1 + Selector2 {}s
				2. h4+P{}
			4. General Sibling Combinator
				1. Selector1 ~ Selector2 {}
				2. h4 ~ p {}
				3.  selects all elements that match 2nd selector
		
4. Precedence of Selectors:
	1. id >span[id='text']> class > Type
5. types of CSS adding:
	1. inline
		1. <element style="property1:value1;property2:value2">Content</element>
		2. used expicially when repeted will not heppaen time.
		3. Page loading time increases
		4. maintenance will be difficult
	2. Embedded(internal)
	3. External
		1. <link rel="stylesheet" href="Path of the CSS file">


	inline > id >class >element(if required use)

6. inheritance styling:
	1. Inheritance is a mechanism where the styling properties of the parent will be passed down to the children.
	2.  styling was applied for the body tag. But the color was applied for every element inside the body tag. This phenomenon is called Inheritance.
	3. note:  if you have applied a background image for the body tag, will all the child elements of the body tag have the background image?

	The answer is No!

7. Pseudo-classes:
	1. CSS pseudo-class can be described as a keyword that is added to a selector which defines a special state of the selected elements.
	2. a:hover{
        color:green;
   	 }
	3. styling links:
		1. :link	It is used to style links which are not visited.
		2. :visited	Styles the state of link when link is visited atleast once.
		3. :hover	Styles the state of the link when mouse is placed over the link.
		4. :active	Styles the state of the link, when you can click on the link.
		5. correct order of writing pseudo classes are(top to bottom) - link , visited, hover, active

	4. styling input field:
		1. :focus	Styles the state of element that is currently targeted or activated by mouse.
		2. :enabled	Styles the state of element that is enabled and associated with input field.
		3. :required	Styles the input element with required attribute.
		4. :checked	Styles the state of element when it is selected.

8. Pseudo Elements:
	A CSS pseudo-element can be taken as a keyword that is added to a selector which lets you to design a specific part of the selected elements. 
	1. input::placeholder{ 
            color:red; 
            font-style:italic; 
            font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; 
        }  
	above meaning is for placeholder of input field add the style.
	2. different pseudo-elements  
	::first-line	-Used to style first line of the text.
	::first-letter	Styles the first letter of text. Applied only to block level elements.
	::before	Used to insert content or style before the content of element.
	::after	Used to insert content or style after the content of element.
	::selection	Used to style the portion of element that is selected by the user.
	3. Note: The double colon represents the pseudo-elements, while single colon represents pseudo-classes 

9. Units in CSS are:
	1. Absolute Units - cm, In, Mm, Px
	2. Relative Units - %, em, rem, vw and vh
		1. percent unit is relative to the viewport size. 
		2. if inner child keept as width of 700px and outer parent is given with width=50% then that 50% will be applied on 700px(i.e..350px)
		3. percentage units consider padding and margins. 
		4. vw and vh will not consider about padding and margins.
		5. if you keep em then: font-size of the content = font-size in the parent element * font-size in the child class
			if font-size is 2em then:
			font-size = 2*parent font-size = 2* 15px = 30px
		6. if you keep rem then: font-size of the content = font-size in the parent element * font-size in the child class
			if font-size is 2rem then:
			font-size = 2*root font-size (root font-size means overall 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------		
CSS Box Model:

1. properties of Box model:
	1. margins
	2. borders
	3. padding
	4. actual content
	from outer side to inner:
		Margin-- Border -- Padding -- Content

	1. Multiple values to margins and padding:
		top, right, bottom, left
	2. we provide 2 values for margin:
		1st value: top-bottom
		2nd value: right-left
	3. we provide 3 values for padding:
		1st value: top
		2nd value: right-left
		3rd value: bottom
	4. width can be calculated as:
		(width + padding on left + padding at right + margin on left + margin at right + border on left + border at right)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS positioning:
movement of position:
	top, left, right, down

position property:
	1. static
		1. bydefault positioned as static
		2. will scroll along with scroller
		3. here top, left, right, down will not work
	2. Absolute 
		1. will shift from its position using movement of position wrt its parent position. if parent unavailable then HTML body is paren
		2. will scroll along with scroller
			div{ position: absolute; top: 20px; left: 30px;}
			here image will move 20px from top of the page and 30px from left of page(ancestors)(not from where is kept)
	3. Relative :
		1. will shift from its position using movement of position
		2. will scroll along with scroller
			div{ position: relative; top: 20px; left: 30px;}
			here image will move 20px  top and 30px left from where it normally would be.
	4. Fixed :
		1. it will not scroll along with scrolller
		2. fixed at that postion
	5. Sticky
		1. fixed at its postion
		2. scroll upto its element came that that that respective will stop scrolling remaining back side will scrole

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FlexBox:
Flexbox is one of the most widely used CSS properties that help us to align elements in given available space.
1. flex supports both expansion and shrinking.
2. properties of flexbox elements are:
	1. display
		values for display:
			1. flex  : the container where display value is flex then remaining properties will be spread over the whole page.
			2. inline -flex  : the container where display value is inline-flex then rem propoerites will be spread upto content is present.
			3. block  : then element will behave like block level element(means starts form new row)
			4. inline block  : then container tries to fit all elements to block level in that line .
	2. flex-direction
		values for flex-direction:
			1. row   : elements will be aligned horizontally
			2. row-reverse  : elements will be aligned horizontally but revrse order
			3. column
			4. column-reverse
	3. flex-wrap
		values are:
			1. nowrap  : not useing anything
			2. wrap   : once the max width of screen is reached then elements wil go to next line
			3. wrap-reverse  : here order is same from left to right but it's not from top to bottom - it is bottom to top 
				ex:  D E
				     A B C     will be output if input is A B C D E
	
	.container{
		padding: 10px;
		border: 2px solid black;
		display: inline-flex;
		flex-direction: row;
		flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
		}

4. properties of flexbox:
	1. align-items: used to align items at different parts of container vertically
		start, end, center,etc
		ex: align-items: flex-start;
	2. justify-content : used to align items at different parts of container Horizontally
		justify-content: center;



---------------------------------------------
1. span + p - p that is just after adjacent sibling of span
2. span * p - select p that is inside span or inner of span or inner inner of span........
3. span ~ p - select every p that come after span even at far 
4. span > p -select p that is direct child of span(just inner p not inner inner p),in between any one there dont take any thing even p because it not inner.
5. span < p - not valid




variations of attriutes selectors:
	1. $= usage - last same
	2. slign='right'    - excat matching
	3. ~=  attribute in space separated list
	4. *=  attribute in anywhere in text( no need of spaces)
	5. ^= starting with



CSS media queries with logical operators:
	1. and - combine multiple conditions
		@media screen and (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1200px){
			body{
				background: red;}}
	2. not  - styles applie if condition is false
	3. only - specific to particular value
		@media screen and (max-width: 1200px){
			body{
				background: red;}}
	4. , OR - if any condition is true it is enough

		




** correct order of writing pseudo classes are(top to bottom) - link , visited, hover, active
* absolute position - element leaves normal flow and arrange itself to nearest position ancestor
