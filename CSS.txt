1. CSS is a decelerative language which means we don't bother about what happen on backend just we will use for application.
2. properties:
	1. color  		: diff colors
	2. text-align		: left, right, center, justify
	3. text-decoration	: none, underline, overline, line-through, blink
	4. font-size		: px or em value
	5. font-style		: normal, Italic, oblique, initial, inherit
	6. background-color	: give color, transparent
	7. border		: 5px solid red
	8. border-radius	: 5px
	9. overflow		: scroll, hidden, auto, visible
	10. display		: none, block, inline-block
	11. opacity		: number(means 0.5)
	12. background-image	: url()
	13. text-transform	: uppercase, lowercase

3. CSS selectors: Selector is a pattern that can select multiple HTML elements using the HTML element attributes like class, id, etc...
	1. Tag_Name{property: value}Â 
	2. types of selectors:
		1. Universal selector - *
		2. id   - #
		3. class - .
		4. type - directly use the attribute.
		5. attribute selector: 
			1. p[id] - select all p with any id
			2. [attribute=keyword]-
				1. p[id="pId"] - select all p with same id
				2. [attribute *= keyword]  : select which is having keyword any where in that attribute.
				3. [attribute^=keyword]  : select which is having keyword at beginning.
				4. [attribute$=keyword]  : select which is having keyword at end of value.
				attribute can be anything like id, href,name etc.
				[ name^= "happy"] {/*Styling properties*/} selects <div name="happyFace">Hello World</div>
	3. Combinators: he selectors formed by combining multiple selectors and establishing a relationship between the selectors.
		1. Selector1 (>, +, ~, (space)) Selector2
		2. The different types of combinators are:
			1. Descendant Combinator  :
				1.Selector1 Selector2{}
				2. #firstDiv .p1{}
			2. Child Combinator
				1. Selector1 > Selector2 {}
				2. ol>li{} - just child of ol ki
			3. Adjacent Sibling Combinator
				1. Selector1 + Selector2 {}s
				2. h4+P{}
			4. General Sibling Combinator
				1. Selector1 ~ Selector2 {}
				2. h4 ~ p {}
				3.  selects all elements that match 2nd selector
		
4. Precedence of Selectors:
	1. id > class > Type
5. types of CSS adding:
	1. inline
		1. <element style="property1:value1;property2:value2">Content</element>
		2. used expicially when repeted will not heppaen time.
		3. Page loading time increases
		4. maintenance will be difficult
	2. Embedded(internal)
	3. External
		1. <link rel="stylesheet" href="Path of the CSS file">
6. inheritance styling:
	1. Inheritance is a mechanism where the styling properties of the parent will be passed down to the children.
	2.  styling was applied for the body tag. But the color was applied for every element inside the body tag. This phenomenon is called Inheritance.
	3. note:  if you have applied a background image for the body tag, will all the child elements of the body tag have the background image?

	The answer is No!

7. Pseudo-classes:
	1. CSS pseudo-class can be described as a keyword that is added to a selector which defines a special state of the selected elements.
	2. a:hover{
        color:green;
   	 }
	3. styling links:
		1. :link	It is used to style links which are not visited.
		2. :visited	Styles the state of link when link is visited atleast once.
		3. :hover	Styles the state of the link when mouse is placed over the link.
		4. :active	Styles the state of the link, when you can click on the link.

	4. styling input field:
		1. :focus	Styles the state of element that is currently targeted or activated by mouse.
		2. :enabled	Styles the state of element that is enabled and associated with input field.
		3. :required	Styles the input element with required attribute.
		4. :checked	Styles the state of element when it is selected.

8. Pseudo Elements:
A CSS pseudo-element can be taken as a keyword that is added to a selector which lets you to design a specific part of the selected elements. 
	1. input::placeholder{ 
            color:red; 
            font-style:italic; 
            font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; 
        }  
	above meaning is for placeholder of input field add the style.
	2. different pseudo-elements  
	::first-line	-Used to style first line of the text.
	::first-letter	Styles the first letter of text. Applied only to block level elements.
	::before	Used to insert content or style before the content of element.
	::after	Used to insert content or style after the content of element.
	::selection	Used to style the portion of element that is selected by the user.
	3. Note: The double colon represents the pseudo-elements, while single colon represents pseudo-classes 

9. Units in CSS are:
	1. Absolute Units - cm, In, Mm, Px
	2. Relative Units - %, em, rem, vw and vh
		1. percent unit is relative to the viewport size. 
		2. if inner child keept as width of 700px and outer parent is given with width=50% then that 50% will be applied on 700px(i.e..350px)
		3. percentage units consider padding and margins. 
		4. vw and vh will not consider about padding and margins.
		5. if you keep em then: font-size of the content = font-size in the parent element * font-size in the child class
			if font-size is 2em then:
			font-size = 2*parent font-size = 2* 15px = 30px
		6. if you keep rem then: font-size of the content = font-size in the parent element * font-size in the child class
			if font-size is 2rem then:
			font-size = 2*root font-size (root font-size means overall

CSS Box Model:

1. properties of Box model:
	1. margins
	2. borders
	3. padding
	4. actual content
	from outer side to inner:
		Margin-- Border -- Padding -- Content

	1. Multiple values to margins and padding:
		top, right, bottom, left
	2. we provide 2 values for margin:
		1st value: top-bottom
		2nd value: right-left
	3. we provide 3 values for padding:
		1st value: top
		2nd value: right-left
		3rd value: bottom
	4. width can be calculated as:
		(width + padding on left + padding at right + margin on left + margin at right + border on left + border at right)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS positioning:
movement of position:
	top, left, right, down

position property:
	1. static
		1. bydefault positioned as static
		2. will scroll along with scroller
		3. here top, left, right, down will not work
	2. Absolute 
		1. will shift from its position using movement of position with respect to its parent position.
		2. will not scroll along with scroller
	3. Relative :
		1. will shift from its position using movement of position
		2. will scroll along with scroller
	4. Fixed :
		1. it will not scroll along with scrolller
		2. fixed at that postion
	5. Sticky
		1. fixed at its postion
		2. scroll upto its element came that that that respective will stop scrolling remaining back side will scrole
